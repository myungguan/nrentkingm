# amCharts Plugin: Auto Guides

Version: 1.2


## Description

Automatically add guides to mark out preset days, like weekends using guides.

Current version of the plugin supports date-based Serial charts and Stock Chart
only.


## Installation

To enable, include `autoGuides.min.js` on your web page.

I.e.:

```
<script src="//www.amcharts.com/lib/3/plugins/tools/autoGuides/autoGuides.min.js"></script>
```

This needs to go **after** all other amCharts includes.


## Usage

The plugin works by ditching pre-defined categories and creating it's own 
categories at specific angles.

To set plugin settings, use `autoGuides` block:

```
"categoryAxis": {
  "parseDates": true,
  "autoGuides": {
    "days": [ 0, 6 ],
    "hours": [ 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 , 5, 6 ],
    "lineColor": "#000",
    "lineAlpha": 0.2,
    "fillColor": "#000",
    "fillAlpha": 0.2
  }
}
```

Use `days` array to specify week days to add guide to. Note that 0 is Sunday,
1 - Monday, and all the way to 6 - Saturday.

Or, if you'd rather mark out certain hours of the day, use `hours` array 
instead.

Since the plugin will create a guide for each matching day, you can add any
Guide setting to it which will be applied to the guides.

### Stock Chart

Stock Chart works the same way, except the `categoryAxis` block goes into each
panel config.

### How do I configure it to work with Data Loader plugin?

No additional configuration is necessary. The plugin will automatically detect 
its cousin -- Data Loader plugin -- and adapt to it.
