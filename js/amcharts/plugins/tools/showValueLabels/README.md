# amCharts Plugin: Show Value Labels

Version: 1.2.0


## Description

For each grid line, displays a label which shows the current value.

Works with serial and stock charts.

## Installation

To enable, include `showValueLabels.min.js` on your web page.

I.e.:

```
<script src="//www.amcharts.com/lib/3/plugins/tools/showValueLabels/showValueLabels.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

To enable, set the `valueLabels` property to `{}` in your `graphs` (or `stockGraphs` if you are using a stock chart):

```
"graphs": [{
  "valueLabels": {}
}]
```

You can also supply additional options:

```
"graphs": [{
  "valueLabels": {
    "labelRotation": 90
  }
}]
```

The options are exactly the same as for [guides](http://docs.amcharts.com/3/javascriptstockchart/Guide).
