# amCharts Plugin: Auto-Hide Legend

Version: 1.0.1


## Description

Hides chart legend if it contains more than certain amount of entries in it.

Works with both serial (Column, Line, XY) and sliced (Pie, Funnel) chart types.

## Installation

To enable, include `autoHideLegend.min.js` on your web page.

I.e.:

```
<script src="//www.amcharts.com/lib/3/plugins/tools/autoHideLegend/autoHideLegend.min.js"></script>
```

## Usage

To enable, add `autoHideCount` property to your `legend` block:

```
"legend": {
  "autoHideCount": 5
},
```

The above will hide the legend automatically if legend contains 5 or more 
entries.
