# amCharts Plugin: Smooth custom bullet images

Version: 1.0.4


## Description

Automatically adds a border radius to custom bullet images set in pixel.

## Installation

To enable, include `smoothCustomBullets.min.js` on your web page.

I.e.:

```
<script src="//www.amcharts.com/lib/3/plugins/tools/smoothCustomBullets/smoothCustomBullets.min.js"></script>
```

This needs to go **after** all other amCharts includes.


## Usage

The plugin creates an individual clip path on every custom bullet image to smooth the corners.

To set plugin settings, use `smoothCustomBullets` block:

```
"smoothCustomBullets": {
    "borderRadius": "auto",
    
    "fillAlpha": 0,
    "fillColor": undefined,

    "borderAlpha": 0,
    "borderColor": undefined,
    "borderThickness": undefined,
    "borderLinejoin": undefined,
    "borderLinecap": undefined,
    "borderDasharray": undefined,

    "positiveOffset": 0,
    "negativeOffset": 3
}
```

By default the plugin uses the `bulletSize` of every data point to smooth the corners which results in a circle and uses the `bulletColor`
if none has been specified.

Parameter | Default | Description
--------- | ----------- | -----------
borderRadius | "auto" | A numeric or string value which defines the size of the curved corner (~"em", ~"ex", ~"px", ~"in", ~"cm", ~"mm", ~"pt", ~"pc").
updateClipPaths | | Method which generates the clippaths and borders.
fillAlpha | 0 | A numeric value from 0 to 1 which controls the opacity of the overlaying layer.

borderThickness | undefined | A numeric value which controls the thickness of the border.
borderLinejoin | undefined | A string value which specifies the shape to be used at the corners of paths or basic shapes when they are stroked.
borderLinecap | undefined | A string value which specifies the shape to be used at the end of open subpaths when they are stroked.
borderDasharray | undefined | A comma separated string value which controls the pattern of dashes and gaps used to stroke paths.
